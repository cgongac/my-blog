Sitting at the corner table. The espresso machine hisses every few minutes. Someone is explaining their startup idea loudly two tables away.

"But if you don't start now, you'll just be a year older when you do."

Specific clarity in that sentence. We wait for the "perfect time", but time just passes regardless.
