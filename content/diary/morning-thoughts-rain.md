Woke up at 6 AM today to the sound of heavy rain. Instead of rushing to check my phone, I just lay there and listened.

There is a specific texture to rain on a city window. It's rhythmic but chaotic. 

Made coffee. The smell of roasted beans mixed with the damp earth smell coming from the open window. It's days like this that I feel most at peace. No need to go anywhere. Just be here.
