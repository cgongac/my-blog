Sundays are for bookstores. 

I went to the dusty one on the corner, the one that smells like vanilla and old paper. I found a second-hand copy of *Essence of Style*. The margins are filled with notes from a previous owner.

I love finding marginalia. It's like having a conversation with a ghost. We are reading the same words, but seeing different things.
