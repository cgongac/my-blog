This week felt slow. Like walking through molasses. 

Normally, I would fight this. I would drink more coffee, set stricter timers, and force myself to output. But this week, I decided to lean into it. I slept more. I worked less. 

The result? I didn't get as much done on my todo list, but the work I did do was better. It was more thoughtful. 

Maybe "productivity" isn't about constant output. Maybe it's about matching your energy to the task at hand.
