2025 was... accurate. That's the word that comes to mind. 

I didn't achieve all my goals. I didn't travel as much as I wanted. But everything that happened felt *right*. It felt accurate to who I am becoming.

**Top 3 wins:**
1. Shipped my side project.
2. Read 24 books.
3. Reconnected with old friends.

Here is to 2026. Less planning, more doing.
