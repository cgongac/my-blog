I used to be afraid of the terminal. The blinking cursor felt judging. But after forcing myself to use Vim for a week, I realized something: **typing is the bottleneck**.

We think faster than we can code. Vim removes the friction between thought and code editing.

```bash
vim ~/.vimrc
```

It's not about speed; it's about fluency. It's about editing text at the speed of thought.
