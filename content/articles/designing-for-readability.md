Good typography is invisible. When you read a well-typeset book, you don't notice the font choice, the line height, or the margins. You only see the words.

### Key Principles

* **Measure**: The line length should be between 45 and 75 characters.
* **Leading**: Line height should be generous enough to prevent the eye from skipping lines.
* **Typeface**: Choose a serif for long-form reading. It guides the horizontal flow of the eye.

We often focus so much on the "vibe" of a website that we forget its primary purpose: to convey information. If the text is hard to read, the design has failed, no matter how beautiful it looks.
