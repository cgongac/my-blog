The internet was once a collection of static pages. Then it became a stream—a chronological feed of ephemeral content that disappears as soon as you scroll past it.

**Digital Gardening** is a return to the web as a space for cultivation. It's about:

1. **Seeds**: Short, rough ideas.
2. **Saplings**: Developed thoughts, but still growing.
3. **Evergreens**: Mature, polished content that provides lasting value.

Unlike a blog post which is "finished" when published, a garden note evolves. I might come back to this post in a year and rewrite it completely as my understanding changes. That is the beauty of the garden.
